# Message Generation for Canteen Daily Stock Updates

This project involves generating daily stock update messages for a canteen and sending them to customers. It is designed to improve communication between the canteen and its customers, keeping them informed about the availability of menu items. The project utilizes Python for message generation, Flask for web app development, and plans for integration with Twilio and AWS APIs for message delivery and storage.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to provide real-time updates to customers regarding the availability of food items in the canteen's menu. Customers can subscribe to receive these updates via SMS.

- **Technology Stack:** The project leverages several technologies and frameworks:
  - **Python:** Python is used for message generation, data processing, and backend development.
  - **Flask:** Flask is employed for building a web app that customers can interact with to subscribe and manage their notifications.
  - **Twilio API:** Twilio will be integrated for sending SMS notifications to customers.
  - **AWS API:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be integrated for message storage and management.

- **Status:** This project is an ongoing effort and is yet to be completed. It is continuously developed and improved to enhance customer experience.

## Project Components

The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Web App (Flask):** A web application built with Flask allows customers to:
   - Subscribe to receive daily stock updates.
   - Manage their subscription preferences.
   - Access the canteen's menu and daily stock status.

2. **Message Generation:** Python scripts are used to generate daily stock update messages based on the canteen's inventory and menu.

3. **Integration with Twilio API:** Twilio will be integrated to send SMS notifications to subscribed customers. Customers will receive stock updates via text messages.

4. **Integration with AWS API:** AWS will be integrated to store and manage historical message data, allowing for analysis and future improvements.

## Project Roadmap

The project roadmap includes the following planned activities:

- Completion of the web app with user registration, subscription management, and menu display.
- Integration with the Twilio API to enable SMS notifications.
- Integration with the AWS API for message storage and retrieval.
- Regular updates and enhancements to improve customer experience and system functionality.

## Conclusion

The Message Generation project for canteen daily stock updates is an ongoing effort aimed at improving communication between the canteen and its customers. It leverages Python, Flask, Twilio, and AWS to provide real-time information to subscribers. As the project progresses, it will contribute to a more efficient and customer-friendly canteen experience.
